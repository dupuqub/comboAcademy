I. Basics.

1. This is a competitive turn-based card game for 2 players.
2. Each player must use a deck of 30 cards.
3. Each deck can contain only 3 copies of each card.
4. Each deck can contain only 1 copy of an exotic card.
5. Exotic cards have asterisks involving the name.
6. Each player also has a side deck called HEALTH.
7. Health is made out of 3 cards named “Heart”.

........................................................................................................................
II. Game flow essentials.

1. The DECK is the 30 selected cards combined.
2. The HEALTH is the 3 "Heart" cards combined.
3. The full deck starts shuffled, face down and (as alligned as possible) in a pile called SOURCE.

  TIP 1. Remember the deck is NOT the source. Some effects may address one of them, some the other.
  TIP 2. Remember that "Heart" cards are NOT part of the deck.

4. There is always a challenger and a challenged.
5. The challenged always plays 1st.
6. The 1st player (P1) DRAWS 5 cards.
7. Drawing a card means getting it from the top of the source.
8. This new pile in the player's hand is named POOL.

  TIP 3. Effects may transfer cards between every pile in the game, but the word DRAW is reserved.
  TIP 4. Pool is not "hand" as most games because there is a game mechanic that simulates the player's actual hands.

9. P1 plays some of its pool (maybe every card of it) and then finishes its TURN.
10. Turn is the player's actions in a ROUND.
10. Round is both player's turns.
11. The 2nd 1st player (P2) draws 7 cards and then plays.
12. Henceforth (3rd turn and beyond) turns are preceded by a standard draw, NOT by a solid number as 5 or 7 as before.
13. A standard draw is when a player draws cards until it has 5 in its pool.
14. Each player's pool has a limit of 10 cards.

  TIP 5. Having 5 or more cards in pool clearly awards no draws in the beggining of a turn.

15. Some cards are offensive and some are defensive, some are both.
16. Being offensive enough will eventually FLIP your foe's "Heart" cards.
17. Flipping a "Heart" is putting it facedown because all "Heart" cards start facing up and side by side.
18. A player WINS when its foe has no more "Heart" cards to be flipped.
19. Only 1 "Heart" may be flipped in a turn.
20. A "Heart" gets flipped when an incoming attack is greater than the defense gathered.

  TIP 6. In a non-standard game more or less "Heart" cards may be used as long as both players have the same amount.

........................................................................................................................
III. Discarding and destroying cards.

1. Some cards get discarded as in most card games. They go to a pile called TRASH.
2. Trash can be recycled into a new source when the source is emptied.
3. Some cards get destroyed. They go to a pile called LIMBO.
4. Cards in limbo are rarely used twice in a match because only special effects take cards out of it.
5. If a player at one point has to draw cards but has none in both the SOURCE and the TRASH, it loses.

IV. Playing a simulation.

1. Each card is unique, but their types have some intrinsic behaviours associated to them.
2. There are 6 card types:

  a. Attack.
  b. Defense.
  c. Scroll.
  d. Terrain.
  e. Assist.
  f. Trap.

3. Attacks, defenses and scrolls are IN LINE cards.
4. Terrains, assists and traps are OFF LINE cards.
5. Cards also have 1 or 2 schools (were the techniques were developed in lore).
6. These are the schools and their respective colors and terrains:

  a. Rock  => Magenta => Mountain.
  b. Earth => Purple  => Swamp.
  c. Water => Blue    => Lake.
  d. Ice   => Cyan    => Glacier.
  e. Air   => Green   => Forest.
  f. Spark => Yellow  => Desert.
  g. Fire  => Orange  => Volcano.
  h. Metal => Red     => Cave.

7. Schools are important to some effects, but schools don't carry special mechanics, so they won't be featured below.
8. To understand better these cards and their properties let's play a simulation:

  a. Suppose it is the 1st turn of the match, and therefore P1 draws 5 cards.
  b. P1 plays 1 attack card. Let's say this is an attack card named "Punch" and it says "+5 ATTACK".
  c. Since this card is an attack, it is in line. It means it stays face up so both players can see it fully.
  d. P1 then plays a "Strong Punch" that says "+10 ATTACK if after 'Punch'". It stays to the right of the 1st.
  e. Since "Super Punch" is after "Punch", its effect is activated.
  f. P1 then plays one last attack called "Final Punch" that says "+10 ATTACK if last card with 'Punch' in name".
  g. This card is also (as for every in line card) placed to the right of the last.
  h. It is clear now that a line is forming. This is the COMBO and the definition of what is to be an IN LINE card.
  i. P1 still has 2 cards in pool, but decides not to play them.
  j. Every card in a pool is retained for the player's next turn.
  k. Now is the P2 turn. It sees the combo it has to respond to, 1 "Punch", 1 "Strong Punch" and 1 "Final Punch".
  l. P2 draws 7 cards and will try to respond to the incoming 25 attack.
  m. P2 plays 2 cards called "Synergy Energy" that say "+4 DEFENSE per 'Synergy Energy' in line".
  n. P2, now with 16 DEFENSE, plays an exotic card called "Avoidance" that says "+10 DEFENSE".
  o. P2 completely avoided the incoming 25 attack with 26 defense and now is free to invest in offensive behaviours.
  p. P2 plays a terrain named "Mountain", it says "Cannot be destroyed in its 1st round."
  q. There can only be 1 terrain active per match.
  r. If either player plays a terrain in the future, "Mountain" will be destroyed in the process.
  s. But because of its effect, neither player can destroy it this turn (P2's turn) or the next (P1's turn).
  t. A player cannot destroy its own terrain just by wanting. A terrain can only be destroyed by another or some effect.
  u. P2 also plays an exotic attack named "Single Axe Throw" that says "+20 ATTACK if only attack in line".
  v. P2 passes the turn with still 2 cards in pool. Remember that henceforth every turn is preceded by a standard draw.
  w. P1 now discards the last combo it made then draws 3 cards to complete 5 in pool.
  x. P1 has a terrain called "Forest", but it cannot be played yet because of the "Mountain" effect.
  y. P1 plays a scroll named "Swift Comeback" that says "PHASE. Draw 1 card per 10 ATTACK taken".
  z. P1 then draws 2 cards because it is taking 20 damage. P1 has now 6 cards in pool and "Swift Comeback" in line.
  aa. Having the phase status means that every time the card gets DISCARDED it goes to the bottom of the source instead.
  ab. P1 plays 1 assist named "Oak Bark Shield" that says "CRUMBLE. +2 DEFENSE per card in both pools".
  ac. The crumble status means whenever the card would get discarded, it gets destroyed instead.
  ad. P1 plays 1 assist named "Stretch Club" that says "+1 ATTACK per every card in both lines".
  ae. P1 now has used up all its 2 HAND slots. Assists can only be used if equipped to a hand.
  af. Some assists may use up to 2 hands. This number is shown through a closed hand symbol in the card.
  ag. If one assist is equipped on top of another, the older is destroyed, NOT discarded.
  ah. P1 plays 1 defense named "Elemental Aura" that says "+8 DEFENSE if at any terrain".
  ai. P1 plays 1 defense named "Recurrent Aura" that says "+2 DEFENSE per defense card in line".
  aj. P1 finishes its turn. Because both players have 2 cards in pool (total of 4), "Oak Bark Shield" gives 8 defense.
  ak. "Elemental Aura" gives another 8 defense and "Recurrent Aura" gives 4, for a total of 20 defense.
  al. P1 defended perfectly and attacked X from "Stretch Club".
  am. "Stretch Club" value will change depending on the amount of cards P2 plays because it is an attack card.
  an. P2 now discards its combo and prepares to defend the X attack (currently 3).
  ao. P2 makes a standard draw of 3 cards.
  ap. P2 plays an scroll named "Struggling Roots" that says "BURN. Destroy any assist".
  aq. Only scrolls can burn. It means the card is destroyed immediately after its use.
  ar. P2 uses "Struggling Roots" to destroy "Stretch Club" and consequently has nothing more to defend.
  as. P2 still wants to get rid of "Oak Bark Shield", but it will have to use other methods not discussed before.
  at. Every assist has a SHIELD value. This value works mostly like the player's defense.
  au. For example, "Oak Bark Shield" has 8 in shield. This number is shown through a shield symbol in the card.
  av. P2 says to P1 that its line will aim "Oak Bark Shield".
  aw. Players may claim aim at assists before, during or after building the combo.
  ax. Players may only claim aim at assists before passing the turn.
  ay. It means that P1 will have 8 extra defense next turn.
  az. It also means that if more than 8 attack is delivered by P2, "Oak Bark Shield" will be discarded in the process.
  ba. Every defeated assist is discarded, NOT destroyed. Remember that replaced assists are destroyed.
  bb. Assists may have the GUARD status in text. It means it naturally stays in the way of any attack.
  bc. P2 plays a trap named "Hateful Mates" that says "Destroy the 1st 1 handed assist played by anyone".
  bd. Traps are played off line, but P2 is only able to play it because at least 1 of its hand slots are free.
  be. Traps share this game feature with assists, but traps always need only 1 hand free.
  bf. To play a trap without free slots means to destroy the equip in place.
  bg. Traps are normally discarded after they are used, unless under rare special effects.
  bh. P2 plays a 2 handed assist (avoiding its own trap) named "Chainsickle" that says "+2 ATTACK per card in line".
  bi. This is because a player cannot choose when to activate traps.
  bj. If it can be proven that a player did not activate its trap the 1st possible time, the player loses the match.
  bk. P2 plays an scroll named "Double Edged Cestus" that says "+7 ATTACK or +7 DEFENSE".
  bl. Every card with "or" effect must be rotated 90 degrees (left or right) to signal which effect was chosen.
  bm. The options "left" and "right" are written in such effects for clarity.
  bn. The "or" effect in assists may be reset every round.
  bo. Traps with "or" effects must be activated when either trigger is activated. They are hard to handle.
  bp. Some cards may have "and" effects along with "or" ones, but the "or" must always only feature 2 possibilities.
  bq. On a last note, some cards will require special conditions in order to be played or to continue in play.
  br. The need when played is defined in card under SUMMON and the need to exist under STAY.
  bs. A card without its summon or stay requirements cannot be played.
  bt. A card that looses its stay requirements is discarded, NOT destroyed.
  bu. And well... This is it for now. If new features arise, this simulation shall grow to accommodate them.

9. Players are able to handle every card in every own pile to count them.
10. Players may read the cards at every own pile, except for the source (unless special effects are activated).
11. Players may ask for their foe's pile amounts. Some cards may be based in such numbers.
12. Don't lie and don't cheat.
